Rinse, Wash, Repeat (RWR) is a powerful and flexible configuration management tool designed for those who like hop around and reinstall a lot regardless if it's Linux, macOS, and Windows. It aims to simplify the process of setting up and maintaining your system, making it easy to rebuild and reproduce configurations across multiple machines.

== Features

- *Blueprint-based Configuration*: RWR uses configuration files called blueprints (similar to Chef cookbooks or Ansible playbooks) to define and manage your system's configuration.
- *Multi-format Support*: Blueprints can be written in YAML, JSON, or TOML format, providing flexibility and compatibility with your preferred configuration format.
- *Package Management*: RWR integrates with various package managers, allowing you to easily install, remove, and manage packages across different Linux distributions.
- *File and Directory Management*: RWR provides functionality to manage files and directories, including copying, moving, deleting, creating, and modifying permissions and ownership.
- *Service Management*: RWR allows you to manage system services, including starting, stopping, enabling, and disabling services across different operating systems.
- *Repository Management*: RWR supports managing repositories for different package managers, such as apt, brew, dnf, zypper, and more.
- *Variable Substitution*: Use variables in your blueprints to make your configurations more dynamic and reusable.
- *Extensible Architecture*: RWR is built with extensibility in mind, allowing you to easily add support for new package managers, file synchronization backends, and more.

== Packages

RWR packages are available for various platforms and architectures through goreleaser. You can find the pre-built packages on the link:https://github.com/thefynx/rwr/releases[releases page] of the RWR repository.

The following package types are available:

- Binary archives (`.tar.gz`, `.zip`)
- Debian packages (`.deb`)
- RPM packages (`.rpm`)
- Homebrew taps
- Scoop buckets

== Installation

To install RWR, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release of RWR from the link:https://github.com/thefynx/rwr/releases[releases page].
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.
3. Add the directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

== Getting Started

To get started with RWR, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the RWR configuration by running `rwr config init`. This will prompt you to enter your preferences and create a default configuration file.
2. Set up your blueprints' repository:
   - If you're using a Git repository, provide the repository URL during the configuration initialization.
   - If you're using local blueprints, place your blueprint files in the specified local path.
3. Run `rwr sync` to synchronize your blueprints repository and ensure you have the latest version.
4. Run `rwr init` to initialize your system based on the blueprints.

== Commands

RWR provides the following commands:

- `rwr config`: Manage RWR configuration settings.
  - `rwr config init`: Initialize the RWR configuration.
- `rwr sync`: Synchronize the blueprints repository.
- `rwr all`: Initialize the system by running all blueprints.
- `rwr run`: Run individual processors.
  - `rwr run package`: Run the package processor.
  - `rwr run repository`: Run the repository processor.
  - `rwr run services`: Run the services processor.
  - `rwr run files`: Run the files processor.
  - `rwr run directories`: Run the directories processor.
  - `rwr run templates`: Run the templates processor.
  - `rwr run configuration`: Run the configuration processor.
- `rwr validate`: Validate the RWR blueprints.

== Blueprint Structure

RWR blueprints are flexible and can be structured according to your needs. The `init.yaml` file serves as the main entry point for your blueprints and defines the order of execution. Here's an example blueprint structure:

....
.
├── configuration
│   └── configuration.yaml
├── files
│   ├── file.yaml
│   └── src
│       ├── config.ini
│       └── script.sh
├── init.yaml
├── packages
│   └── packages.yaml
├── services
│   └── service.yaml
└── templates
    ├── src
    │   ├── index.html.tmpl
    │   └── nginx.conf.tmpl
    └── templates.yaml
....

In this example structure:

- The `files/src` directory contains actual files to be copied or used, such as `config.ini` and `script.sh`.
- The `templates/src` directory contains template files, such as `index.html.tmpl` and `nginx.conf.tmpl`, which can be processed and rendered during the execution of the blueprints.

However, RWR doesn't enforce a strict structure. You can organize your blueprints in a single folder with all YAML, TOML, or JSON files, depending on your preference. The `init.yaml` file allows you to specify the order of execution and the location of your blueprint files.

== Blueprint Types

RWR supports the following blueprint types:

- `packages`: Defines packages to be installed or removed using various package managers.
- `repositories`: Defines repositories to be managed for different package managers.
- `files`: Defines files to be copied, moved, deleted, created, or modified.
- `directories`: Defines directories to be managed, including creation, deletion, and modification of permissions and ownership.
- `services`: Defines services to be managed, including starting, stopping, enabling, and disabling services.
- `templates`: Defines template files to be processed and rendered during the execution of the blueprints.
- `configuration`: Defines configuration settings to be applied to the system.

* *Multi-format Support*: Blueprints can be written in YAML, JSON, or TOML format, providing flexibility and compatibility with your preferred configuration format.
* *Package Management*: RWR integrates with various package managers, allowing you to easily install, remove, and manage packages across different Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows. Now supports specifying additional arguments for package installation.
* *File and Directory Management*: RWR provides functionality to manage files and directories, including copying, moving, deleting, creating, and modifying permissions and ownership. Supports URL sources for files and intelligent renaming.
* *Service Management*: RWR allows you to manage system services, including starting, stopping, enabling, and disabling services across different operating systems.
* *Repository Management*: RWR supports managing repositories for different package managers, such as apt, brew, dnf, zypper, and more.
* *User and Group Management*: RWR allows you to create and manage user accounts and groups on your system.
* *Template Rendering*: RWR supports rendering templates with variable substitution, making your configurations more dynamic and reusable.
* *Git Repository Management*: RWR can clone and manage Git repositories as part of the configuration process.
* *Script Execution*: RWR allows you to execute scripts as part of the configuration process, providing additional flexibility and customization options.
* *Bootstrap Process*: RWR includes a bootstrap process that can be used to set up the initial system configuration, including installing essential packages, creating directories, and setting permissions.
* *Variable Substitution*: Use variables in your blueprints to make your configurations more dynamic and reusable.
* *Extensible Architecture*: RWR is built with extensibility in mind, allowing you to easily add support for new package managers through TOML-based provider configurations, without needing to write Go code.
* *SSH Key Management*: RWR can generate and manage SSH keys, including copying public keys to GitHub and setting a key as the default RWR SSH key for operations. Supports both file paths and Base64-encoded SSH keys for Git authentication.

== Blueprint Structure

RWR blueprints are organized in a structured directory hierarchy. Here's the current blueprint structure:

[source,text]
----
.
├── bootstrap.yaml
├── files
│   ├── dots.yaml
│   ├── files.yaml
│   └── src
│       ├── .config
│       ├── desktop
│       ├── dotFiles
│       ├── ssh
│       └── Wallpapers
├── git
│   ├── org.yaml

== Development

=== Prerequisites

RWR uses https://mise.jdx.dev/[mise] to manage development tools. Install mise following their documentation.

=== Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/fynxlabs/rwr.git
cd rwr
----

2. Install required tools:
[source,bash]
----
mise install
----

This installs:

* Go (for building and testing)
* Dagger (for CI/CD pipeline)
* GoReleaser (for creating releases)
* gotestsum (for beautiful test output formatting and CI integration)

=== Development Commands

RWR provides several commands for different development scenarios:

==== Local Development (No Dagger)

Fast commands that run directly on your machine:

[source,bash]
----
# Build the binary
mise run build

# Run tests with beautiful formatting (uses gotestsum)
mise run test

# Run raw tests without formatting
mise run test:raw
----

==== Unit Testing Commands

For targeted testing of specific components, all with beautiful gotestsum formatting:

[source,bash]
----
# Run all internal package tests (package-level summary)
mise run test:unit

# Run tests for specific packages (detailed test names)
mise run test:helpers     # Test helper functions
mise run test:processors  # Test blueprint processors
mise run test:system     # Test system utilities

# Run tests with coverage report
mise run test:coverage

# Watch mode - automatically run tests when files change
mise run test:watch
----

For raw test output without formatting, use the `:raw` variants:

[source,bash]
----
# Raw test commands (no gotestsum formatting)
mise run test:unit:raw
mise run test:helpers:raw
mise run test:processors:raw
mise run test:system:raw
----

NOTE: gotestsum provides superior test output formatting, watch mode for development, and saves test results to `/tmp/gotest.json` for CI integration and analysis.

==== Pipeline Testing (Using Dagger)

Test the CI pipeline locally using Dagger:

[source,bash]
----
# Just run tests through Dagger
mise run dagger:test

# Test full release pipeline without publishing
# This will:
# 1. Run tests
# 2. Build binaries
# 3. Create archives
# 4. Skip actual publishing
mise run dagger:local

# Run full CI pipeline with publishing
# Requires:
# - GITHUB_TOKEN for creating releases
# - HOMEBREW_TAP_DEPLOY_KEY for updating Homebrew tap
mise run dagger:ci
----

==== Individual Dagger Functions

You can also run individual Dagger functions for specific tasks:

[source,bash]
----
# Build binary through Dagger
mise run dagger:build

# Run linting through Dagger
mise run dagger:lint

# Test release process locally (without publishing)
mise run dagger:release

# Get version information
mise run dagger:version

# Clean Dagger generated files (useful for dependency issues)
mise run dagger:clean
----

=== CI/CD Pipeline

RWR uses Dagger to manage its CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline:

1. On every push and PR:
   * Runs tests through Dagger
   * Reports test results

2. On version tags (v*):
   * Runs tests
   * Creates GitHub release with:
     * Binary archives (.tar.gz, .zip)
     * Debian packages (.deb)
     * RPM packages (.rpm)
   * Updates Homebrew tap

The pipeline can be tested locally using the commands above, making it easy to verify changes before pushing.

==== Environment Variables

For publishing releases:

* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub token with permissions to:
  * Create releases
  * Upload release assets
  * Update repository contents
* `HOMEBREW_TAP_DEPLOY_KEY`: SSH key with access to update the Homebrew tap repository

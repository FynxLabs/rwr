# Best Practices

This page outlines the best practices and recommendations for organizing blueprints, managing configurations, and keeping your system maintainable with Rinse, Wash, Repeat (RWR) when used on personal machines.

## Organizing Blueprints

When organizing your blueprints, consider the following best practices:

1. Use a consistent naming convention for your blueprint files, such as `<blueprint-type>.yaml` (e.g., `packages.yaml`, `repositories.yaml`).

2. Group related blueprints into subdirectories for better organization. For example:

    ```text
    blueprints/
    ├── packages/
    │   ├── core.yaml
    │   └── development.yaml
    ├── repositories/
    │   ├── common.yaml
    │   └── personal.yaml
    └── services/
        └── web.yaml
    ```

3. Split large blueprints into smaller, focused files for better readability and maintainability.

4. Use meaningful names for your blueprints, variables, and templates to make your configuration self-explanatory.

## Managing Configurations

When managing configurations for your personal machine, consider the following best practices:

1. Use variables to parameterize values that may change, such as file paths, URLs, or personal preferences.

2. Create separate blueprint files for different use cases or configurations (e.g., `core.yaml` for essential packages, `development.yaml` for development tools and libraries).

3. Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to your blueprints and maintain a history of your configurations.

4. Consider using branches or tags in your version control system to represent different configurations or snapshots of your system.

## Keeping Your System Maintainable

To keep your system maintainable with RWR, consider the following best practices:

1. Regularly update your blueprints to reflect changes in your system or application requirements.

2. Use comments in your blueprints to document complex configurations or provide explanations for specific settings.

3. Avoid duplicating configuration settings across multiple blueprints. Instead, use variables or templates to centralize common configurations.

4. Test your blueprints thoroughly in a virtual machine or isolated environment before applying them to your local system.

5. Maintain a backup of your system configuration or create snapshots before applying significant changes to your local system.

## Using Profiles Effectively

Profiles allow you to organize and selectively install configurations based on different contexts. Consider these approaches:

1. **Environment-based profiles**: Separate development, testing, and production configurations.

    ```yaml
    packages:
      # Always installed
      - name: git
        action: install
      # Development only
      - name: docker
        action: install
        profiles: [development]
    ```

2. **Role-based profiles**: Organize tools by user roles or responsibilities.

    ```yaml
    packages:
      # Developer tools
      - name: vscode
        action: install
        profiles: [developer]
      # Designer tools
      - name: figma
        action: install
        profiles: [designer]
    ```

3. **Use meaningful profile names**: Choose names that make sense to you and your team. There are no naming restrictions - use whatever works for your context.

4. **Document your profiles**: Add comments explaining what each profile is intended for.

5. **Test profile combinations**: Use `--dry-run` to preview what will be installed before running commands.

## Security Considerations

When working with RWR, keep the following security best practices in mind:

1. Protect sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, by using variables and storing them securely (e.g., using environment variables or a secure storage system).

2. Regularly update your system packages and dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

3. Limit access to your RWR configuration files and repositories to authorized users only.

4. Use secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) when accessing remote repositories or servers.

By following these best practices, you can create well-organized, maintainable, and secure configurations with RWR, making it easier to manage your personal machine and test configurations safely before applying them to your local system.
